# Setu Finance Non-Technical Requirements

For the more detailed product and acceptance requirements, see [requirements.md](requirements.md).

## Purpose

Setu Finance should give the operations team one place to onboard clients, bill them, capture payments, review exceptions, and send receipts without depending on disconnected spreadsheets, inboxes, and manual memory.

## Primary Users

- Finance operations staff who onboard clients, create invoices, and apply payments
- Program administrators who manage referral rules and policy settings
- HR/operations leaders who maintain employee records and payroll-like finance visibility
- Employees, sales users, and existing clients who submit referrals through a no-login public form
- Leadership users who need a clean dashboard of collections, outstanding balances, and operational issues

## Business Outcomes

- Reduce manual re-entry between onboarding, invoicing, payment review, and receipt sending
- Start intake from the signed contract instead of retyping billing setup from scratch
- Keep a durable history of client enrollments, billing activity, and payment decisions
- Make Zelle-based collections easier to reconcile without removing human control over final posting
- Let employees, sales users, and customers refer prospects without giving them access to the finance portal
- Ensure every new referral is reviewed by finance before rewards or relationships are established
- Give leadership visibility into employee payables, referral payouts, and other operating expenses by region
- Give finance a single searchable Contracts archive with signed-with party, short summary, signed date, Quick peek, and Download
- Let staff ask AskSetu quick read-only questions from current portal data
- Support future expansion into a broader product suite by using stable customer IDs and reusable customer records

## Required Business Capabilities

### 1. Client onboarding must happen first

- The system must let staff upload one or more signed contracts as the starting point before invoicing begins.
- The system must parse key contract fields such as services, fees, installments, and service-start date when possible.
- Staff must be able to override or add fields manually before saving the onboarding record.
- The system must let staff create or update a client profile before invoicing begins.
- First name, last name, primary email, phone number, and at least one service enrollment must be required.
- Home address should be available as an optional field for future billing and compliance needs.
- Each enrolled service must keep the date and time when that service was added.
- The system must allow clients to enroll in additional services later without losing historical enrollment records.
- The service list shown during onboarding should stay compact and use short service labels that finance can scan quickly.

### 2. Client records must be reusable

- Every client must have a stable customer ID that can be used across finance and future product modules.
- The client record must support multiple contact details and payment identity hints.
- Search must work across name, email, phone, aliases, and invoice references.
- The customer register should show a clearly defined status for each customer so finance can tell at a glance whether the record is active, awaiting payment, overdue, or needs review.
- Clicking a customer should open a full 360 page with signup date, contact details, service history, invoices, transaction history, referrals, rewards, and current billing or contract context.
- The customer 360 page must show uploaded contracts and critical extracted fields such as fee, service-start date, installment count, and contract file link.
- A dedicated Contracts archive must let finance search client and employee contracts without opening each customer or employee page.
- Contract rows must show who the contract is signed with, a short summary, and the signed date.
- Users must be able to quick-preview supported contracts before downloading the raw file.

### 3. Invoicing must be fast and controlled

- Staff must be able to create invoices from an existing client record.
- The invoice flow should use the client’s enrolled services as the default choices.
- Contract-derived installment schedules should be able to create draft invoices automatically during onboarding.
- The system should support draft, sent, paid, and overdue invoice states.
- The system must support invoice email sending.

### 4. Payment capture must be structured

- The system must store incoming payment transactions in a dedicated transaction record.
- When a Zelle confirmation email is synced, the portal must capture as much structured information as possible in one place, including:
  - transaction date
  - transaction number
  - amount
  - memo
  - email sender details available from the message
  - destination inbox details
  - raw extracted message text for audit and review
- Captured transactions must remain saved even if they are not immediately applied.

### 5. Matching must support human review

- The matching engine should identify the most likely customer and invoice using saved customer information and invoice context.
- Clear matches should appear in a `Payments to confirm` queue.
- Unclear or mismatched transactions should appear in an `Exceptions` queue.
- When an exception is resolved, the system must keep a durable history of that decision, including the action taken, the user who took it, and when it happened.
- When a finance user manually selects the right customer from an exception, the transaction must immediately attach to that customer’s history before the final apply step.
- When a finance user explicitly accepts a linked exception, the payment should apply immediately and the acceptance must be visible in exception history.
- Duplicate exceptions should stay blocked by default, and the same Zelle transaction number must never be applied twice.
- Reused Zelle transaction numbers should be clearly flagged as possible abuse or replay risk for direct bank verification.
- Finance users should be able to record and apply a payment manually when funds are secured through bank transfer, manually verified Zelle, check, cash, card, or another alternate route.
- A finance user must be able to complete the final apply step with one click.
- Applying a transaction must update the account, invoice state, and activity history together.

### 6. Receipts must be sent from the client record

- Once a payment is applied, the transaction must remain visible in a completed ledger so finance can send or re-send the receipt separately.
- The receipt must go to the customer’s primary email from the database.
- The receipt should be attached as a simple PDF for the customer’s records.
- The receipt should include the important confirmation details, such as amount, transaction number, payment date, memo, invoice reference when available, and the confirmation timestamp.

### 7. Dashboard visibility must support simple finance review

- Leadership and finance users should be able to see amounts received over time in one dashboard view.
- The dashboard should let users switch the received-amount chart between day, week, month, and year ranges.
- The chart must use date or period on the x-axis and summed received amounts on the y-axis.
- Duplicate-blocked transactions must not be counted in those received totals.

### 8. Referral program rules must be configurable

- The system must support referral relationships between existing and newly onboarded clients.
- The system must provide a separate public Referral Engine form for employees, sales users, customers, and other referrers.
- The public referral form must not require finance-portal login.
- Referrers must be able to search themselves by email, phone, or employee ID.
- Email and phone lookup must search both employee and customer records after consent.
- Employee ID lookup must search only the employee database.
- If the referrer cannot be matched automatically, the referral must still be saved for finance identity review.
- Every new referral must go through finance-admin approval before a referral relationship, reward, payout, or invoice adjustment is established.
- The system must prevent obvious duplicate referred-client entries and self-referrals.
- The system must store who referred whom, the relationship type, and the referral date.
- Referral bonuses should default to `$500`, but the amount must be configurable by admins.
- Qualification should default to `at least $3,000 paid or 6 months`, but both values must be configurable by admins.
- Admins must be able to disable the referral program for new enrollments without deleting historical referral records.
- Historical referral records must preserve the rule snapshot active when the referral was created.
- Qualified customer referral bonuses must be applied as discounts on a future invoice, not as direct credits.
- Qualified employee or sales referral rewards must route through the employee payables process before payment.
- Finance users should be able to see which customers are qualified for a referral bonus, which invoice will receive the discount, and who applied it.
- Reporting should be simple enough for non-technical users to understand referral relationships, qualified value, and total bonus spent.

### 9. Employee records must support HR and finance visibility

- The system must maintain employee records separately from customer records.
- Finance or HR users must be able to onboard employees with an assigned employee ID.
- Employee records must capture name, personal and official email, personal and official phone, region, department, title, manager, employment type, status, and HR comments.
- Employee records must capture joining date, termination or exit date, promotion date, and other important lifecycle dates.
- Employee records must capture monthly salary, one-time joining bonus, annual bonus, salary-effective date, and currency.
- Employee status must distinguish current employees from terminated, left, suspended, contractor, or other appropriate states.
- Each employee must have a 360 view with profile, status, compensation context, referral identity, and payment history.
- Every payment made to an employee must be recorded with type, amount, currency, date, reference, memo, recording user, and region.
- Employee payables must roll up clearly in the Payables section by region.
- Employee contracts must be searchable in the central Contracts archive and must show the employee name as the signed-with party.

### 10. Other expenses and income must be tracked

- The system must provide an `Other` section for expenses that are not customer invoices or employee payments.
- Examples should include work laptops, facilities rent or lease, software, travel, marketing, insurance, legal, accounting, tax, utilities, and miscellaneous expenses.
- The same section should support received entries such as refunds, reimbursements, rebates, grants, or other income.
- Every entry must capture category, direction, vendor or source, amount with cents, currency, date, region, department, reference, memo, and recording user.
- Other expenses and income must appear in Payables reporting without interfering with receivables or customer payment application.

### 11. The portal must be safe for internal finance work

- The portal must require login before finance data is visible.
- Payment application must stay human-controlled.
- Important state changes should be traceable in system history.
- In cloud environments, uploaded contracts must be stored in a private S3 bucket organized by owner category, owner ID, and date.
- AskSetu must be read-only and answer current-state questions about customers, invoices, payments, contracts, employees, payables, Gmail sync, outbound email, referrals, and recent activity.

## Non-Functional Expectations

- The system should stay affordable to run at low volume.
- The product should be ready to grow into a suite, not just a single billing page.
- The design should favor auditability and explainability over opaque automation.
- The architecture should support later addition of bank APIs, job queues, and multi-tenant models.

## Out of Scope for This Phase

- Public client self-service portal
- Fully automatic posting of payments without human review
- Multi-tenant customer isolation for multiple organizations
- Advanced analytics warehouse or BI platform
- Full bank API integration beyond the current Gmail/Zelle ingestion path

## Success Criteria

- A finance team member can onboard a client, send an invoice, review a synced Zelle transaction, apply it, and send or re-send a PDF receipt without leaving the portal.
- A public referrer can submit a referral, finance can approve it, and only then can the relationship and reward path become active.
- Finance can onboard an employee, record employee payments, and see the spend reflected by region.
- Finance can record an operating expense or received refund and see it reflected in Payables reporting.
- Leadership can see outstanding invoices, pending confirmations, exceptions, referral progress, employee payables, other expenses, and received-amount trends in one system.
