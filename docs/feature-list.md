## 5. Matching And Exception Handling

- Deterministic matching engine using name, email, phone, aliases, amount, and invoice context

  - archive a duplicate when finance confirms it should not be counted

- Email and phone lookup searches employee and customer records after explicit consent
- Employee ID lookup searches only the employee database
- Unknown referrers can still submit for manual finance identity review
- Every new referral intake requires finance-admin review before any relationship or reward is established

## 9. People And Employee Ledger

- Dedicated `People` section for finance and HR-style employee administration
- People landing is grouped around `Employee Directory` and `Onboard Employee`
- `Onboard Employee` is shown above the directory so HR can add a person without browsing existing records
- Employee count metrics summarize total, current, paid transactions, and former employees
- Employee Directory does not list all employees by default, which keeps the page usable for 300+ employees
- Directory results appear only after search/filter input and are capped to the top 10 most relevant matches
- Employee directory search supports first name, last name, employee ID, email, phone, department, title, status, and region
- Department, title, and region use controlled dropdown values
- Supported regions are US, India, and Nigeria, with local payroll currency USD, INR, and NGN
- Employee onboarding with assigned employee ID
- Captures first, middle, last, and preferred name
- Captures personal and official email, personal and official mobile, region, department, manager, title, and employment type
- Captures joining date, termination or exit date, promotion date, HR comments, and status
- Tracks monthly salary, one-time joining bonus, annual bonus, currency, and salary-effective date
- Maintains employees separately from customers while allowing referral matching across both populations

- Employee 360 supports uploading signed offer letters, NDAs, employment agreements, policy acknowledgements, and other HR files

## 10. Contracts Library

- Dedicated authenticated `Contracts` workspace for finance, HR, and admin users
- Search-only archive across client, employee, stakeholder, vendor, NDA, offer letter, and other contract records
- Contract records are grouped by category, signed-with party, short summary, signed date, and explicit actions
- Client contracts show the client/customer name the contract is signed with, such as Lohith Deshpande
- Employee contracts show the employee name the contract is signed with
- Contract summaries are intentionally compact so the list remains scannable
- Client contract records come from client onboarding and customer 360 uploads
- Employee contract records come from employee 360 uploads in People
- Contracts library itself does not upload files, preventing accidental orphaned contract records
- `Quick peek` opens supported PDFs, images, and text files inline through the authenticated API before a user downloads anything
- Download links are protected by admin authentication
- Storage keys are categorized by owner type, owner ID, and date so local storage can map directly to a private S3 bucket design

## 11. Other Expenses And Income

- Dedicated `Other` entry path inside Payables
- Supports expenses such as laptops, software, rent, leases, travel, marketing, insurance, taxes, legal, accounting, utilities, and miscellaneous categories
- Supports received entries such as refunds, reimbursements, rebates, grants, and other income
- Captures vendor/source, amount with cents, currency, category, direction, region, department, date, reference, memo, and recording user
- Other entries roll into Payables reporting so leadership can see money out and money received outside invoices

## 12. V2 Finance Information Architecture

- New v2 shell navigation: `Executive`, `Clients`, `Receivables`, `Payables`, `Referrals`, `People`, `Contracts`, `Settings`, and `Audit`
- Workday-style global search in the authenticated shell for fast navigation across pages, tasks, customers, employees, invoices, payments, referrals, contracts, and feedback
- Search suggestions are grouped by category and can be opened with click or Enter
- Global search supports first-three-letter task matching, full-text keyword matching, and direct customer/employee 360 deeplinks
- Search result selection is navigation-only and does not automatically sync Gmail, apply payments, create invoices, or send receipts
- Legacy operational routes are preserved: `/dashboard`, `/billing`, `/customers`, `/customers/:id`, `/onboarding`, `/admin`, and `/settings`
- New aliases are available for the merged IA: `/clients`, `/receivables`, `/referrals`, `/payables`, `/people`, and `/audit`
- `Clients` wraps existing onboarding, customer register, and customer 360 flows without changing their backend contracts
- `Receivables` wraps the existing billing console and keeps Gmail/Zelle sync, payment application, exception review, manual payment entry, and receipt sending intact
- Receivables is organized into tabs for `Overview`, `Invoices`, `Payments to confirm`, `Exceptions`, `Receipts`, and `Inbox sync` so finance users can move through one queue at a time
- `Payables`, `People`, `Referrals`, and `Audit` are active product-suite surfaces while preserving existing receivables flows
- `Contracts` centralizes searchable client and employee files without introducing a separate upload path
- Existing Gmail sync credentials, token path, SMTP settings, and sync services are preserved

- Shows feedback in the admin workspace for review
