# Setu Finance User Guide

This guide explains how to use the Setu Finance portal by function. It is written for finance operators, admins, and business users.

## 1. Access The Portal

Use this when you need to sign in and start work.

1. Open the portal.
   - Local: `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
   - AWS dev primary: `https://3.135.234.59.sslip.io`
   - AWS dev recovery: `https://18.218.196.158.sslip.io`
2. Enter the portal username.
   - Default username: `admin`
3. Enter the portal password configured by the admin.
4. After login, the portal opens on the Dashboard.
5. Click the `setu` logo anytime to return to the Dashboard.

Security note: do not store real production passwords in GitHub documents. Keep passwords in `.env`, AWS SSM Parameter Store, or AWS Secrets Manager.

## 2. Dashboard

Use this to understand the current finance position.

1. Open `Dashboard` from the left navigation.
2. Review the top summary cards for collections, outstanding balances, active customers, pending payments, and exceptions.
3. Review the received-amount chart.
4. Use the day, week, month, and year controls to change the chart drilldown.
5. Review referral chart and bonus-spend summary.
6. Use the dashboard as the starting point for daily finance review.

What to watch:

- `Payments to confirm` means money was captured and matched, but still needs human apply.
- `Exceptions` means the system needs a human decision.
- Duplicate or replay-risk transactions are not counted in totals.

## 3. Global Search

Use this when you know what you are looking for but do not want to click through the side navigation.

1. Click the search bar in the top header.
2. Type a page, task, customer, employee, invoice, transaction, referral, or feedback keyword.
3. Review the grouped suggestions.
4. Press `Enter` to open the top suggestion, or click the exact result.
5. Use customer ID, employee ID, email, phone, invoice number, transaction number, or the first few letters of a task for faster lookup.

Important rules:

- Search results navigate you to the right page, tab, or 360 view.
- Search does not automatically sync Gmail, apply payments, create invoices, or send receipts.
- If no result appears, check spelling or try a more exact ID/email/phone.

## 4. Client Onboarding

Use this when a new client signs up or when an existing client adds services.

1. Open `Client onboarding`.
2. Start with `Contract intake`.
3. Upload signed contract files if available.
4. Review the fields prefilled from the contract.
5. Confirm or correct:
   - first name
   - last name
   - primary email
   - phone
   - enrolled services
   - fee type
   - billing cadence

   - invoice schedule
6. Add optional details if available:

   - referral source
   - Zelle sender alias
7. Select all services the client enrolled for.
8. Use `Custom` if the service is not in the default list.
9. Confirm enrollment date/time for each service.
10. Review generated invoice schedule.
11. Click save/onboard to create or update the customer.

Important rules:

- First name, last name, email, phone, and services are mandatory.
- Service history is append-only; later services should be added with their own enrollment date.
- Uploaded contracts remain linked to the customer 360 page.

## 5. Customer Search

Use this to find customers quickly.

1. Open `Customer search`.
2. Search by any of these:
   - customer ID
   - first name
   - last name
   - email
   - phone
   - alias
3. Review the spreadsheet-like results.
4. Check the customer status column.
5. Click a customer row to open the full customer 360 page.

Useful statuses:

- `Active`: customer is in normal active state.
- `Awaiting payment`: invoice was sent and payment is pending.
- `Payment ready`: payment is ready for finance apply.
- `Overdue`: invoice is overdue.
- `Duplicate review`: payment needs duplicate review.
- `Mismatch`: payment amount does not match expected amount.
- `Needs follow-up`: onboarding or billing details are incomplete.

## 6. Customer 360 View

Use this to see the full customer history.

1. Open a customer from `Customer search`.
2. Review customer identity and contact details.

## 8. Send Due Invoices

Use this during daily billing review.

1. Open `Billing console`.
2. Go to `Due to send today`.
3. Review each invoice in the queue.
4. Click `Send` for a single invoice.
5. Or click `Send all` if every due invoice is ready.
6. Confirm the queue updates after sending.

## 9. Sync Zelle Inbox

Use this to pull Zelle confirmation emails into the portal.

1. Open `Billing console`.
2. Click `Sync Zelle inbox`.
3. Wait for the sync result.
4. Review newly captured records in:
   - `Payments to confirm`
   - `Exceptions`
5. If no new payments appear, check sync settings and Gmail authorization in `Settings`.
6. If sync reports `Gmail authorization expired or was revoked`, run `npm run gmail:authorize` locally and retry sync.

What the sync captures:

- amount with exact cents
- sent date
- transaction number
- memo
- sender name
- Gmail message/thread details
- raw extracted text

Important rules:

- The sync only reads relevant Zelle subject patterns.
- Previously processed Gmail messages are skipped.
- Same Zelle transaction number cannot be applied twice.

## 10. Review And Apply Payments

Use this when a payment is matched and ready for finance approval.

1. Open `Billing console`.
2. Go to `Payments to confirm`.
3. Review the customer, invoice, amount, transaction number, memo, and match score.
4. Click `Review & apply`.
5. Confirm details in the review modal.
6. Click `Apply transaction`.
7. The payment moves to `Completed transactions`.
8. Invoice status updates if the payment matches an invoice.
9. Referral qualification updates if applicable.

Important rules:

- Applying payment and sending receipt are separate actions.
- Do not apply if the customer, amount, or transaction details look wrong.

## 11. Resolve Exceptions

Use this when the system cannot safely auto-match or apply a payment.

1. Open `Billing console`.
2. Go to `Exceptions`.
3. Click `Review`.
4. Read the transaction details and reason.
5. Click `Approve & apply` only when the funds and customer are correct.
6. If the customer is unclear, search for the existing customer and either `Approve & apply` or `Assign only`.
7. Click `Reject / archive` when the record should not be applied.
8. Review rejected records in `Rejected / archived bucket`.
9. Delete from the archived bucket only after checking the confirmation box, typing `DELETE`, and entering a reason.
10. If the same Zelle transaction number already exists, treat it as possible abuse/replay risk.
11. After resolution, confirm the action is visible in exception history.

Important rules:

- Duplicate exceptions cannot be accepted/applied.
- Same Zelle transaction number must never be applied twice.
- Rejected and archived records are retained in the bucket; delete is a soft-delete with audit history, not silent data loss.
- Every exception action is saved with the user and timestamp.

## 12. Record Manual Secured Payment

Use this when funds are confirmed outside Gmail/Zelle email sync.

1. Open `Billing console`.
2. Click `Record manual payment`.

8. Select invoice if known.
9. Add memo.
10. Add internal verification note.
11. Click `Record & apply payment`.
12. Send receipt later from `Completed transactions`.

Important rules:

Use this after a payment has been applied.

1. Open `Billing console`.
2. Go to `Completed transactions`.
3. Find the payment.
4. Check receipt status.

Receipt includes:

- customer name
- customer ID
- amount
- transaction/reference number
- payment date

## 14. Referral Program

Use this to review Referral Engine intake, manage referral relationships, and apply rewards.

10. Review reporting for relationships, qualified rewards, and bonus spend.

Important rules:

- Customer referral bonus is applied as a discount on an invoice.
- Employee referral bonus is routed to Payables as an employee referral payout.
- Rules are configurable in `Settings`.
- Historical referrals preserve the rule snapshot active when created.

## 15. Public Referral Engine

Use this when customers, employees, sales team members, or other referrers submit referrals without logging in.

1. Share `/refer` with the referrer.
2. Referrer chooses email, phone, or employee ID.
3. Email and phone can match customer or employee records.
4. Employee ID matches employee records only.
5. Referrer confirms the identity belongs to them before details are shown.
6. If the referrer is not found, they can submit their own details for manual finance review.
7. Referrer selects likely services.
8. Referrer enters referred client name and at least one client contact: email or phone.
9. Referrer selects how they know the client.
10. Referrer reviews terms and submits.
11. Finance sees the entry in `Referral Program` before any reward is created.

Important rules:

- Duplicate referred client email or phone is blocked.
- Self-referrals are blocked.
- Reward estimates are recomputed by the server.
- Public submission alone does not create a payable or invoice discount.

## 16. People

Use this to onboard employees, maintain HR/finance fields, and review employee payment history.

3. Use the `Onboard Employee` form at the top of the page to add:

   - official and personal mobile
   - title, department, region, and manager
   - employment status
   - joining and exit dates
   - monthly salary, joining bonus, and annual bonus
   - HR comments and critical information
4. Click `Create employee`.
5. Use `Employee Directory` search to find an existing employee by name, employee ID, email, phone, department, title, or region.

7. Click `Employee 360` for the correct employee.
8. Review status, role, contact details, HR comments, compensation, referrals, payment history, contracts, and payslips.
9. Use `Record employee payment` to capture salary, joining bonus, annual bonus, referral bonus, reimbursement, or other payments.
10. Use `Employee contracts` to upload signed offer letters, NDAs, employment agreements, policy acknowledgements, or other HR files.
11. Use `Generate payslip` for a calendar month or custom pay cycle.
12. Click `Download PDF` beside a generated payslip to share it with the employee.

Important rules:

- Employee records are separate from customer records.
- The directory does not show all employees by default.
- Search results are capped at 10; narrow the search if the right person does not appear.
- Employee ID search in the public Referral Engine searches employee records only.
- Employee payment amounts preserve exact cents.
- Uploaded employee contracts appear in both Employee 360 and the central `Contracts` workspace.

6. Click `Quick peek` to preview supported PDFs, images, or text files inside the portal.
7. Click `Download` only when you intentionally want the raw contract file.

Important rules:

- Contracts space is search-only; do not upload files here.

- Employee contracts show the employee name in `Signed with`.
- Upload client contracts from client onboarding or customer 360.
- Upload employee contracts from employee 360 in People.
- Quick peek and downloads require an authenticated admin session.
- Quick peek streams through the Setu backend even when files are stored in a private AWS S3 bucket.
- In AWS, the same metadata maps to private S3 keys grouped by owner category, owner ID, and date.

## 18. Payables

Use this to track money-out and other finance entries.

1. Open `Payables`.
2. Review employee paid total, referral payouts due, other paid total, and other received total.
3. Review expense distribution by region.
4. Use `Record other expense or income` for laptop purchases, rent/lease, software, legal/compliance, travel, marketing, professional services, training, refunds, income, or other categories.
5. Choose direction: `Paid` or `Received`.
6. Enter vendor/source, amount, date, region, department, payment method, memo, and reference.
7. Click `Record other entry`.
8. Review employee payment ledger and employee referral payout ledger.

Important rules:

- Customer referral rewards remain invoice discounts in Receivables.
- Employee referral rewards appear in Payables as scheduled referral payouts.
- Other `Received` entries are tracked separately from money-out.

## 19. Public Feedback Form

Use this when customers, prospects, or test users need a simple place to share feedback.

1. Share `/feedback` with users.
2. User enters name, email, optional customer ID, optional phone, feedback area, optional rating, and feedback message.
3. User may attach up to 3 optional files, such as screenshots or PDFs.
4. The portal saves the feedback into the admin review queue.
5. Admin opens `Referral Program` and reviews the `User feedback` section.
6. Admin opens any uploaded attachment when more context is needed.
7. Admin marks the feedback as reviewed or archives it.
8. If engineering follow-up is needed, admins can separately create a GitHub Issue from the reviewed feedback.

Important rules:

- Do not ask customers to use GitHub Issues directly for sensitive billing or payment details.
- Use GitHub Issues for internal engineering follow-up, not as the primary public feedback intake.
- Attachments should be used only when helpful and should not include unnecessary sensitive data.

## 20. Settings
