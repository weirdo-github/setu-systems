### In Plain English

- First upload the signed contract.
- Let Setu prefill services, fee, installments, and dates.
- Adjust anything manually if the contract needs a finance override.
- Save the client and the generated draft invoices.
- Then send the invoice.
- When money shows up, save it as a transaction record.
- If the portal is confident, finance applies it from `Payments to confirm`.
- If the portal is not confident, finance resolves it in `Exceptions`.
- After apply, the transaction stays in history and the receipt can be sent separately.

## What This Means Operationally

- Contract upload is the first step. Finance should start from the signed agreement before invoicing begins.
- Parsed contract details should prefill the client record, services, billing cadence, fee, installments, and service-start date wherever possible.
- Admins can manually override contract-derived values before the record is saved.
- Every service enrollment is timestamped so later add-on services remain historically traceable.
- Contract binaries and extracted critical fields stay linked to the customer record and are visible in customer 360 plus the Contracts archive.
- The Contracts archive shows signed-with party, compact summary, signed date, Quick peek, and Download without exposing internal storage details to operators.
- Synced Zelle emails are converted into durable transaction records with captured details such as amount, transaction number, memo, dates, source emails, and raw extracted text.
- The system does not auto-post money blindly. A human still decides when to apply a prepared transaction.
- Applying a payment and sending a receipt are now separate actions.
- Completed transactions stay visible after apply so finance can send or re-send a receipt later if needed.
- Receipts are sent as PDF attachments to the customer’s primary email on file.
- Referral progress and rewards update only after a payment has actually been applied.
- Qualified referral bonuses are not paid out as standalone credits. Finance applies them to the next eligible draft invoice so the customer simply sees a lower invoice amount.
- Special referral campaigns can raise or lower the bonus and qualification thresholds for future enrollments without corrupting historical relationships.

## Exception Paths

- If the payer identity is unclear, the transaction goes to `Exceptions`.
- If the amount does not match the expected invoice amount, the transaction goes to `Exceptions`.
- If the same payment appears twice, duplicate controls prevent it from being counted or applied twice.
- If the same Zelle transaction number appears again, the portal blocks it as a possible abuse/replay risk for bank-level verification.
- If finance confirms a non-duplicate exception is a valid payment, the `Accept transaction` action applies it and stores the decision in exception history.
- If funds are secured outside Gmail sync, finance can record a manual payment and then send the same PDF receipt from completed transactions.
- When finance resolves an exception, that decision stays in exception history with the resolution action, user, and timestamp.
- If no invoice exists yet, the payment can still be saved, reviewed, and linked later.
- If a client enrolls in more services later, onboarding adds new dated history instead of overwriting the original record.
